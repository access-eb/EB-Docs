title: "3. Connect Google Ads Conversion to GTM"
---

## Step 1 - Access Google Tag Manager
1. Open **Google Tag Manager** (GTM).
2. Navigate to the **Tags** section.
3. Click **New** to create a new tag.
4. Set up the **Conversion Linker**:
   - **Tag Type:** Conversion Linker
   - **Trigger:** All Pages (Page View)
   - This ensures the conversion data is linked to the user's session.

## Step 2 - Configure Google Ads Conversion Tracking
1. Set the **Tag Type** to **Google Ads Conversion Tracking**.

:::warning
**Important:** Be cautious when copying and pasting IDs. Sometimes, pasting may not select the entire string.
**Example:** `5789dnnihba-` → The `"-"` at the end may not be included.
:::

2. Paste the **Conversion ID** and **Conversion Label** from the previous step:
   - **[Retrieve Conversion ID and Label (Step 8)](create_conversion.mdx)**
3. For **Conversion Value, Transaction ID, and Currency Code**, we will use **custom variables** populated from the **Data Layer**.
4. Enable **User-Provided Data Collection** by setting up a **custom variable** that stores all the necessary data.
5. Set the **Trigger** to fire on the desired event.
6. Save the tag. We will return to it later after creating the custom variables.

## Step 3 - Create User-Defined Variables
1. Navigate to the **Variables** section > **User-Defined Variables**.
2. Click **New** to create a new variable.
3. Name the variable appropriately.
4. Set the **Variable Type** to **Data Layer Variable**.
5. Set the **Data Layer Variable Name** to match the variable that contains the relevant data.
   - Example Data Layer:
   ```json
   {
     "ecommerce": {
       "currencyCode": "USD"
     }
   }
    ```
- The Data Layer Variable Name should be ecommerce.currencyCode.
- Click Save.

## Step 4 - Set the Trigger
    - If your Google Ads conversion is Purchase, set the trigger to fire on the purchase event.
        - This is typically a custom event in GTM.

## Step 5 - Install GTM4WP Plugin (For WordPress Users)
If your site is built with WordPress, use the GTM4WP plugin to integrate GTM effectively.
    - Install the GTM4WP plugin.
    - Navigate to the GTM4WP settings:
         https://yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gtm4wp_settings
    - Paste your GTM Container ID in the Container ID field.
    - Container Code ON/OFF: ON
    - Container Code Compatibility Mode: OFF
    - Navigate to Basic Data and select the relevant tracking options.
    - In Basic Data > Visitors, choose the data you want to track.
    - Go to **Events** > **General** Events and enable:
        - New User Registration
        - User Logged In
    - In **Integration** > **WooCommerce**, check the desired options.
    - Save the settings.

## Step 6 - Test the Setup
- Return to Google Tag Manager.
- Use Preview Mode to verify that tracking is working correctly.

:::tip
How to Verify Your Setup in Google Ads:
    - Go back to Google Ads and check your conversion status.
    - If the conversion is inactive, you should see a Troubleshoot button.
    - Click Troubleshoot to open Google’s preview mode and track the event specifically.
    - If the event triggers correctly, you’ll see a confirmation message.
    - If the event doesn't fire, click Finish and review your settings.
